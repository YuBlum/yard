the entire game is written in a fictional language

--except for menus and stuff that the main character is supposed to understand -- maybe even that can be discarted and make the whole game be written in this fictional language--

actually all ui and menus have 0 text, only text in the game are on written in the conlang

you can create your own translator dictionary in game

design the game so that text is only required for story

design the conlang itself to be really simple and easy to grasp

make all of the language be based on simple sound effects (like undertale/animal crossing). so tecnically the game will have voiced dialogue
